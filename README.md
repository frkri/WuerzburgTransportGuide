# WuerzburgTransportGuide

A simple Java desktop application that uses the [VVM Netzplan](https://netzplan.region-mainfranken.de/) to display public transport information for the city of WÃ¼rzburg and its districts.
It is based on the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) framework and uses the [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) HTTP client library to communicate with the VVM Netzplan API.

VVM does not provide an official API for their Netzplan service, so this project uses a reverse engineered API specification. Consequently, the API may change at any time and without notice, treat it as uncompleted and unstable.
This project is not affiliated with or supported by the Verkehrsverbund Mainfranken.

## Building

At (minimum) Java Development Kit 20 is required to build this project.
The project uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build system.

### Building the Project

The project can be built using the ``jlinkZip`` Gradle task. This will create a zip archive containing the application and all required dependencies with its own JRE making it easy to distribute.
NOTE: This task will only generate a zip archive for the platform it is executed on.

The generated zip archive can be found under ``build/distributions``. It can be extracted anywhere and the application can be started by executing the ``bin/WuerzburgTransportGuide`` script.

### Generating the Client API

This project uses the [Open API](https://www.openapis.org/what-is-openapi) specification that describes the [VVM Netzplan](https://netzplan.region-mainfranken.de/) REST API.
This helps us generate the required interface for the [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) HTTP client library.
Using the ``build`` or ``openApiGenerate`` Gradle task will generate the required code (API and Models).
Further custom models (that are not generated) can be added by placing them under ``src/main/java/io.github.wuerzburgtransportguide/model`` and then adding them to the ``openApiGenerate`` task.
Furthermore, the Gson needs to be updated to include the new model with registerTypeAdapter.

The source specification file can be found under ``specs/netzplan.yml`` which itself is generated using [mitmproxy2swagger](https://github.com/alufers/mitmproxy2swagger).

```bash
# Using your browser, navigate to the VVM Netzplan website and perform actions that you want to capture with your network tab open.
# Then export the captured traffic as a HAR file. This can be done using the "Save all as HAR" option in the network tab.

# Setup python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
# or on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install mitmproxy2swagger
pip install mitmproxy2swagger

# Generate Open API specification from your HAR file
mitmproxy2swagger -i <path-to-har-file> -o specs/netzplan.yml -p https://netzplan.region-mainfranken.de/api/
```
